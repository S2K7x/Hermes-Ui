 * Choose how hard this conversation thinks.

 * Nothing is sent to Hermes: like the agent binding, the value is local and
 * reaches the gateway as `model_options` on the next turn (see the stream
 * route). So it applies from the next message, and what is already in the
 * transcript keeps the effort that produced it.
 *
 * An unknown effort is refused rather than quietly normalised to `auto`:
 * upstream *ignores* a level it does not know, which would leave the caller
 * believing it had asked for something.
