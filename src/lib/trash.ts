/**
 * The recycle bin: deleting a conversation stops destroying it.
 *
 * The constraint that decides the whole design: `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}`
 * really does drop the rows from Hermes' `state.db` — transcript, tool calls,
 * FTS5 entries, the lot. There is no undo upstream and no soft-delete flag to
 * borrow. So a bin is only honest if the app **never calls that endpoint**
 * until the grace period is up.
 *
 * Hence: "delete" writes a `deleted_at` on our own `session_meta` row and the
 * conversation drops out of every list this app shows. Upstream, nothing
 * happens at all. The real delete is the sweep, thirty days later.
 *
 * Two things were checked in Hermes' sources before promising thirty days,
 * because a promise nobody upstream has agreed to is not a promise
 * (`hermes_state.py`, `hermes_cli/config_defaults.py`, 0.20.0):
 *
 * - `sessions.auto_archive` — `maybe_auto_archive` is documented as the
 *   "non-destructive sibling": it archives, never deletes. Default `false`.
 * - `sessions.auto_prune` — `maybe_auto_prune_and_vacuum` *is* destructive,
 *   but it is `false` by default, needs `retention_days` (90) of inactivity,
 *   and only touches **ended** sessions. This machine has no `sessions:` block
 *   in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, so both defaults apply and nothing upstream
 *   will collect a conversation out from under the bin.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the arithmetic can be tested against a fixed
 * clock — same convention as `parseSchedule()` and `groupSessions()`.
