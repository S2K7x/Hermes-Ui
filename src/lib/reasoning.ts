/**
 * The reasoning-effort dial, which Hermes has always accepted and we never sent.
 *
 * Verified in `gateway/platforms/api_server.py` (0.20.0): every turn body of
 * `POST /api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream` may carry a `model_options` object, and
 * `_request_reasoning_config()` reads `model_options.reasoning.{enabled,effort}`
 * from it. The result lands on `AIAgent(reasoning_config=…)` — an explicit
 * per-request value wins over `agent.reasoning_effort` in `config.yaml`
 * (`request_reasoning_config if … is not None else _load_reasoning_config`).
 * It is the same knob the CLI's `/reasoning` sets; there is nothing new to ask
 * of Hermes here.
 *
 * Two properties of that upstream code shape everything below:
 *
 * - **The accepted efforts are a closed set** (`_REASONING_EFFORTS`), and
 *   anything outside it is *ignored* rather than rejected — the turn then runs
 *   on the gateway's configured default. So an unknown value can never fail a
 *   turn, but it can silently do nothing, which is why `AUTO` is an explicit
 *   choice here instead of an out-of-range string.
 * - **`model_options` stay request-scoped**, in upstream's own words. The value
 *   is not remembered on the session row, so it has to be re-sent with every
 *   single message — exactly like the agent's `system_message` (CLAUDE.md §18),
 *   and for the same reason it is composed server-side rather than by the
 *   browser.
 *
 * Each provider plugin translates the config for its own wire format
 * (`build_api_kwargs_extras`: OpenRouter → `extra_body.reasoning`, Copilot
 * clamps the effort to what the live catalogue lists, Anthropic → `thinking`
 * and skips Haiku, reasoning-mandatory Claude models get `verbosity` and no
 * `reasoning` field at all). A provider with no override ignores it. That is
 * what makes offering this dial safe: the worst case is a level that has no
 * effect, never a rejected request.
