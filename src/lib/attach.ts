/**
 * Dropping a text file into the composer — pure logic, no DOM.
 *
 * Hermes accepts images and nothing else: `file`, `input_file`, `file_id` and
 * non-image `data:` URLs all come back as 400 `unsupported_content_type` (see
 * CLAUDE.md point 5). So a log, a config or a snippet had no way in at all —
 * the composer refused it with an explanation and the user was left to open
 * the file elsewhere and paste it by hand.
 *
 * Pasting it by hand is exactly what this does, minus the hand: the file is
 * read in the browser and **inlined into the message** as a fenced block with
 * its name above it. Nothing new is asked of the API — what leaves the browser
 * is the same plain prompt it has always accepted.
 *
 * Two rules the rest of the module exists to keep:
 *
 * - **Nothing is ever truncated.** A file too big to inline is refused, with
 *   its size said out loud. A block that arrived half-quoted would be answered
 *   half-quoted, and nothing on screen would say so — the same reasoning as
 *   `MAX_DRAFT_CHARS` in `$lib/drafts`.
 * - **The fence is longer than anything inside it.** A markdown file quoting
 *   ``` would otherwise close the block early, and the tail of the file would
 *   land in the prompt as prose.

 * Read gate, applied to the file's byte size before anything is decoded.
